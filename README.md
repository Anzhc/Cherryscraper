# Cherryscraper
Just a simple small to help with dataset gathering.
Google Web Store is taking too long to approve extension, so im releasing it as is.
## Install
Google approved extension, so you also can get it from official store page - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cherryscraper/dmgibfaenicepbmjcbejibgbaohfkido?hl=en-GB&authuser=0
Open Chrome(i don't think it supports any other browser), navigate to extension tab, turn on developer mode, add unpackaged extension.
