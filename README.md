# Cherryscraper
Just a simple small tool to help with dataset gathering.
Google Web Store is taking too long to approve extension, so im releasing it as is.
### Currently supported sites
Danbooru, Safebooru, Gelbooru, Realbooru, yande.re, chounyuu, e621, tbib, sankakucomplex, rule34, derpibooru, yandex, nozomi, knowyourmeme, pinterest.
Like half of those were added as per suggestions on Civitai discord, so, feel free to ask for your favorite sites that are not covered yet.

## Install  
Google now requires too much for me to bother jumping through hoops i have no need for. Install manually from this repo:
1. Get on the extensions page  

<img width="554" height="151" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8389642-0e4b-41b6-8558-4ac2d4b01db8" />  

2. Load unpacked

Point it to cherryscraper root folder.  

~~Google approved extension, so you also can get it from official store page~~ - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cherryscraper/dmgibfaenicepbmjcbejibgbaohfkido?hl=en-GB&authuser=0

(old, v1, no automatic mode)

## Changelog  
V2.5.0 - fix danbooru, add backup download method that should work with anything. Added auto close for pages for faster gathering.
V2.1.7 - don't recall
V2.1.5 - more sites: metmuseum(because i needed cartography stuff), civitai(cuz yes), and function for generic site scraping(which totally is not a civitai function copy), that you should be able to use for sites that follow a structure of gallery which you can open single images on.  
V2.1 - some more sites, like KnowYourMeme, are supported.  
V2 - automatic mode! Now you can choose to only open page with image you're interested in, and it will get downloaded.  
V1 - it works, download works with press of "c", while you're on image page.  
## Manual installation
Chrome - Open Chrome, navigate to extension tab, turn on developer mode, add unpackaged extension.  
Firefox - google how to add temporary extension, i actually forgor ;-;
